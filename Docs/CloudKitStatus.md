# CloudKit Configuration Status

Rechecking the repository now shows the app entitlements include the CloudKit container `iCloud.com.example.deedstracker`. Running `plutil -p scoremyday2/scoremyday2.entitlements` (or inspecting the plist directly) returns that identifier inside `com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers`, so Xcode will register the container and allow the schema to be created server-side.

To finish enabling CloudKit:

1. Ensure the CloudKit container (`iCloud.com.example.deedstracker`) exists and is assigned to your Apple Developer team.
2. Regenerate and commit updated provisioning profiles so Xcode can sign with the CloudKit capability.
3. Use the CloudKit dashboard to create the desired record types once the container is available.

Without these steps, tapping cards will continue to rely solely on the local Core Data store, and no CloudKit tables will exist. Once the container identifier is committed, the CloudKit dashboard will surface the default zone automatically and you can add record types for deeds and entries from there.
